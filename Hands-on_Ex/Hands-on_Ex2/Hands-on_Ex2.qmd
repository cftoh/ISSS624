This will be built upon the basic of R Programming, after setup

\*\*useful to just type "/" then it will allow easier insert of code chunks (rather than having to type \`\`\`{r} all the time

```{r}

```

Key R Package used is [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/) package in R, but the following will be used to:

-   [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) for importing delimited text file,

-   [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) for tidying data,

-   [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for wrangling data and

-   [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/) for handling geospatial data.

**readr**, **tidyr** and **dplyr** are part of **tidyverse** package.

To first install the package:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)
```
