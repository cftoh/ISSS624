title: "Hands-on Exercise 1: Geospatial Data Wrangling with R"
---

## Overview

In this hands-on exercise, I learn how to import and wrangling geospatial data using appropriate R packages.

## Getting Started!

The code chunk below install and load sf and tidyverse packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)

```

## Importing Geospatial Data

### Importing polygon feature data

```{r}

mpsq <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer="MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")

```

We will next have to save this file as a qmd (in this case Hands-on_Ex1.qmd)

Once done, save it \> click Render \> this will run our codes automatically. The beauty of this is that it teaches us how to create a reproducible data

To update the path from homepage, will then need to go back to the \_quarto.yml doc to update. Can also go Build to "Render website"

Sometimes we need to commit changes from time to time so we can track changes! Dont do it at the very end.
